# DroneSim
Reinforcement learning for path following of an AirSim quadrotor implemented in Unity city environment
### GIF
## Getting Started
- ### Download the [Unity package]() containing the customized city environment and the AirSim drone;
- ### Add the [Path_Following]() directory to the AirSim/PythonClient/reinforcement_learning you've cloned;
- ### You can
  - ### Directly load the pre-trainined model by hitting `python Model_Load.py` in the terminal, and you'll see the drone following the city road
  - ### Train your own model by `python dqn_drone.py`, your trained model is saved as "best_model.zip"
